# 3Q-MSC
Investigate the potential benefits of creating magic states with the use of a native CCZ gates.

Authors: Colin Stewart

-  This will be a computational study with possible tools made specifically for the study
-  This work will be compared against other methods of magic state cultivation
-  Ideally we could see an improvment in QEC resource use and efficiency
